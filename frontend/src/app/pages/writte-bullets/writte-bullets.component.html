      <em>"The frame is more important than the picture."</em><br /><br />
      In 2019, I wrote about what I did, downplayed myself, and hoped the reader
      would "get it". I didn't get a single call back. 2 years later, you
      wouldn't even recognize the bullets that were built off the
      <strong>EXACT SAME EXPERIENCE</strong>.<br /><br />
      You don't need more or better experience. You just need to frame what you
      have in the perfect way.<br /><br />
      In this module we're going to be doing just that."

        Did you know? Apple designs and tests its product boxes to open at just
        the right speed? The highest market cap company in the world. Hundreds
        of millions poured into researching and designing packaging that is
        simply thrown away. Framing is everything.

      Your resume isn't about what you did ‚Äî it's about what changed because of
      you. That's what gets hiring managers saying
      <em>"I want this person"</em>.
