    If you're here, you're already the type of person who takes initiative.
    You‚Äôre not the bottleneck. The bottleneck is how you're presenting the value
    you already have.<br /><br />
    Our goal together in these modules is to make hiring managers see you not as
    just another resume in the pile, but as
    <strong>someone they NEED on their team.</strong><br /><br />
    Let‚Äôs get started."

      Did you know? Apple designs and tests its product boxes to open at just
      the right speed? The highest market cap company in the world. Hundreds of
      millions poured into researching and designing packaging that is simply
      thrown away. Framing is everything.

          These 3 rules apply whether you're a new grad, senior dev, or career
          switcher. If you skip this foundation, nothing else will save your
          resume.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Keep your header clean.</strong> Use a simple,
            <strong>professional email</strong> (like firstname lastname email).
            Include your phone number. Recommend: Include LinkedIn or portfolio
            site.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Ensure it is ATS-safe.</strong> Some say companies use
            software to auto-reject resumes that don't parse cleanly. Verdict is
            out on if this is actually true but better safe than sorry. This
            template is verified to be ATS-safe.<br />
            <small
              >Test that your resume is ATS-safe with this
              <a href="#">resume parsing tool</a>.</small
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lead with experience.</strong> Put your most recent and most
            relevant role first ‚Äî even if it's an internship. Recruiters scan
            for experience first. If your best experience is at the bottom,
            you're sabotaging yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Skills section (optional).</strong> I personally recommend
            having a skills section, primarily to help recruiters skim your
            resume. However, don't go overboard. Quality over quantity.<br />
            <small
              >This is the only step I'd call optional. You can just interlace
              skills in your experience bullets. Use your judgement.</small
